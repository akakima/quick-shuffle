# Quick Shuffle
Shuffle arrays or files. </br>
Algorithm based on Quick Sort, but compare results are random.

According to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle . It's a bad idea.</br>
But, i need only basic shuffle.
</br>
After some testing, the results are not that bad.
TBD: publish tests.
